# Frogit
>Sublime Text plugin displaying in a popup the translation of the words selected with multi-cursor. It uses a personnal FR/EN mapping file that I maintain. This tool helps me to quickly remember EN/FR translations without the hassle to open/search in a translation mapping file. When something is not found it is added to the mapping file for manual translation (automatic will be soon next development)

![click one word + right-click to translate](img/frogit_demo.png)

## Install

Install it manually. Soon... Install `Frogit` with [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) and restart Sublime.

## Getting started

From any sublime tab, right-click an english word, then select 'FrogIt' command to get a popup with the french translation.
