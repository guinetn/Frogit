# Frogit
>Sublime Text plugin displaying in a popup the translation of the words selected with multi-cursors. It uses a personnal EN/FR dictionary file that I maintain. I create this tool to helps me to quickly find EN/FR translations without the hassle to open/search in a dictionary or personnal notes. Not found translations are appened to my dictionary file for later manual translation (automatic is planned as the  future development)

![click one word + right-click to translate](img/frogit_demo.png)

## Install

1. Install it manually: copy files into the package folder. 
2. In Frogit.py, set the path to your dictionary file:
  
```
dictionnary = r'C:\My\ENGLISH_FRENCH.md'
```

## Getting started

From any sublime tab, right-click an english word, then select 'FrogIt' command to get a popup with the french translation.
